# Sprite Animation State Skill

Produce a single animated sprite-state study for a playable game moment.
Pixel-art heroes, enemies, pickups, HUD feedback, looping CSS animations,
and clear game-state labels are the default.

## Workflow

1. **Read the active DESIGN.md** (injected above). Pick the loudest serif
   token for the year, a sturdy sans for headlines, and a mono token for
   timeline / index labels.
2. **Pick the topic** from the brief (e.g. "Nintendo · 1889 — Hanafuda").
   You always need: a year, a one-line headline, an animated subject (a
   pixel sprite — character, object, or icon), and a short caption.
3. **Stage** — full-bleed cream / off-white background (`#f5efe2`) with a
   subtle paper grain. Keep margins generous; this is one beat of a video.
4. **Top bar** — small mono row:
   - Left: title slug ("名次の/番組" or "EP. 01 / NINTENDO")
   - Right: progress dots ("01 / 12") and a "REC" stamp
5. **Subject animations** — at least three independent looping animations
   on the stage:
   - **Big year**: the headline year (e.g. "1889年") fills the lower-left,
     in a serif display weight. It has a subtle vertical glitch / scanline
     animation (clip-path keyframes), and a 1-frame "pop" every loop.
   - **Pixel sprite card**: a 96×128 pixel-art card or character (use an
     inline SVG with crisp `shape-rendering: crispEdges` rectangles, or a
     `box-shadow` pixel grid). Subtle bobbing animation (±4px, 1.6s).
   - **Kinetic kana**: 1–2 Japanese / kanji characters that fade-and-slide
     in sync with the bob (e.g. "花" — *hana* — flower).
   - **Tick ribbon**: bottom of the stage, a tape/ribbon with year ticks
     (1889 · 1907 · 1949 · 1977 · 1985 · 2006 · 2017) sliding left at a
     slow constant speed.
6. **Caption block** — small mono caption explaining the trivia:
   "Nintendo started as a Hanafuda playing-card maker in Kyoto, 1889.
    Mario didn't show up for another ninety-six years."
7. **Write** a single HTML document:
   - `<!doctype html>` through `</html>`, CSS inline, no external JS.
   - All animations use `@keyframes` + `animation: ... infinite`.
   - Stage uses a fixed canvas ratio (e.g. 16:9 letterboxed) so the loop
     reads as a single frame from a video.
   - `data-agds-id` on stage, year, sprite, caption, and tick ribbon.
8. **Self-check**:
   - The stage is one cohesive scene, not a collage. The eye lands on the
     year first, then the sprite, then the caption.
   - At least 3 independent looping animations are visible.
   - The color palette is restrained (cream + a single accent red + ink).
   - Motion stays readable, performant, and easy to pause for accessibility.
   - No external assets — all sprites are inline SVG or CSS.

## Output contract

Emit between `<artifact>` tags:

```
<artifact identifier="sprite-anim-slug" type="text/html" title="Sprite animation — Title">
<!doctype html>
<html>...</html>
</artifact>
```

One sentence before the artifact, nothing after.
